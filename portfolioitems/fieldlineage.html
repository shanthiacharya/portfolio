                                  Workday Analytics customers want end-to-end visibility of the data origin and what transformation happens to it
                                  and how it gets used. Data Lineage provides a way to understand where the data is coming from and where it is going. Datasets can have fields with complex logic.
                                   Enterprise users needs to understand:<br/>
                                  1. Where the field originates from <br/> 
                                  2. What transformations and calculations are applied  <br/> 
                                  3. Dependency from both upstream and downstream in the lineage.<br/> 
                                  This is useful to understand the impact of the changes to the field logic to root cause issues, adapt to business changes and data governance.<br/>

                                     2. Does the user understand the flow of the field through various stages and datasets in the pipeline?<br/>

                                     4. Can the user get to the origin of the fields? <br/>
                                     4. Can the user understand how the field it is used downstream?<br/>

                                    1.Blue line highlighted in the dataset lineage guided the user and was useful in understanding related nodes.<br/>
                                    2.Accessibility was easy and intuitive to the field lineage from the inspector panel.<br/>
                                    3.Left to Right flow was easy to understand the direction of upstream and downstream flow (similar to data lineage. <br/>
                                    4.Different persona may use different entry points such as Data Catalog or Lineage and also depends on the question. <br/>
                                    5.Biggest learning was that customers can have very complicated pipeline and the current approach of stacking fields cannot scale.

                                   Journey on this project has been extremely challenging initially exacerbated with the onset of pandemic. New paradigms has to be established to embrace constraints and tackling complexity. 
                                    By focussing on real world scenarios and coming up with shared terminology and rules we were able to simplify and successfully deliver this feature to our analytics customers.
